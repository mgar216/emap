# emap

Run as root with **sudo ./emap.sh <ip>**

emap is a thorough version scanner of all open ports, and also looks for UDP open ports
  
  Written for the OSCP and to have a consistently accurate port scanner that didn't miss versions on open ports, yet still scanned quickly enough to not sit there for 30min.
